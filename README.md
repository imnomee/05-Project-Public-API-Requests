# UNIT 5 PROJECT - Public API Requests

https://imnomee.github.io/Public-API-Requests/

Above is the link of this repo website, if you want to see the API in action.

In this project, we fetched Random User Data from an API (randomuser.me).
We fetch 12 results and displayed their information on the page,
including picture, name, email, city and state.

When a user clicks on any of the generated card,
A modal box is opend with some extra information about the profile,
including Address, Date of Birth etc
with Buttons to close, previous and next. - Close button will close the modal window - Next button will show the next profile - Prev button will show the previous profile

It won't display any errors if the user is on the first or last record.

We implemented a Search box for the fetch profiles.
When a user enters a search string of more than 2 characters, it will display the result profiles
and if there is not match a message is shown on the page.

Sometimes the results will return multiple profiles,
but user can still navigation through the buttons and get next or prev modal
